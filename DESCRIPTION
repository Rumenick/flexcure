Description: The flexcure package provides R implementations for analyze
    survival data, as from flexible parametric survival models with cure fraction.
    In this package, were considered the parametric accelerated failure time models:
    classics, the extended generalized gamma, the generalized F and Marshall Olkin
    extended Weibull, for to model time of susceptible elements. For the cured
    fraction, were considered the usual models of standard mixture and of promotion
    time. There are also tools that permit the exploitation of the fit and functions
    to generate a dataset with cure fraction, using one model specific.
